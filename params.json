","body":"Who am I?*\r\n===\r\n\r\nI am energetic, or even [hectic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbtig6-kFQ) (why this video? Look how *beautiful* and... stressful (or energetic) their dance look like) I'd say, young representant of our future - todays youth generation. \r\n\r\nI have been thinking about cooperating with various _serious_ companies, such as: \r\n\r\n* FM Group (do not mix with FM Logistics), \r\n* Bannersbroker, \r\n* Monavie, \r\n* Lyoness, \r\n* Evotey, \r\n* EcoVital (aka pots with --very high-- quality/price), \r\n* Oriflame, \r\n* Novision, \r\n* Betterware, \r\n* We Atlantis, \r\n* OVB, and others.\r\n\r\n_Please note that I did not provide any links to those companies' websites; interpret this as me expressing that you **really** do not need to be aware of their existence._\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of them were just waiting for me to join them and share enormous amounts of money with me, \r\nbut I am not this kind of guy. I decided to choose my own path, my destiny... \r\n_Bla bla bla..._\r\n\r\nComing back to the topic. \r\n\r\nHerebly I would like to present to you my new achievement. Brick-table. \r\n\r\nWhat's brick-table?\r\n===\r\n\r\nI am almost sure of one thing. We can see tables everywhere. In magazines, leaflets, bruchures, emails and even **in the Internet**. \r\nBut they always look the same. \r\n\r\nThis tool allows you changing that. You can make tablets less boring and more awesome. \r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n===\r\n\r\nIt simply moves (or changes its relative position) every odd row in table by half of its width to the right. *Yes, that's all*. **KISS, dude.**\r\n\r\nDemo\r\n===\r\n\r\n* Table containing a lot of data.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://zippy.gfycat.com/PessimisticPersonalAmericanblackvulture.gif\"/>\r\n\r\n* Excel-like table.\r\n\r\n_Coming soon._\r\n\r\nHow can I use it?\r\n===\r\n\r\n1. Go to your _Web Developer Console_ (probably `Ctrl+Shift+J` or similar, e.g. `Ctrl+Shift+K` in Firefox) \r\n2. and paste content of `brick-table.js` (link [here](https://github.com/arjamizo/brick-table-js/blob/master/bricktable.js)) script. \r\n\r\nFor your convenience I put this script here: \r\n\r\n\t$('table').each(function(i, table) {\r\n\t\t//this function is executed once per every table, so widths are calculated only once.\r\n\t\tvar rowsFunction = (function() {\r\n\t\t\tvar cache = [];\r\n\t\t\treturn function(i, e) {\r\n\t\t\t\te.style['position'] = 'relative';\r\n\t\t\t\te.style['left'] = cache[i] || (cache[i] = (e.clientWidth || $(e).width()) / 2) + 'px';\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t})()\r\n\t\t$(table).find('td').parent().filter(':odd').find('td').each(function(i, e) {\r\n\t\t\tsetTimeout(rowsFunction, 100, i, e);\r\n\t\t})\r\n\t})\r\n\r\nThat's all. _No compilcated installation nor waiting hours for downloading._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPossible usages\r\n===\r\n\r\n* simulating building houses without stopping looking at your screen (tables look like they were bricks), \r\n* trying what floor will look like before buying laminate flooring (aka pergo), \r\n* increasing cleariness and readability of presented data.\r\n\r\nTools used\r\n===\r\n\r\n* Maxthon browser - browser achieving the best ratio (plugins/sloweness)\r\n* jsbeautify.org - keeps code beautifuly indented\r\n* jquery - learning cells width\r\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions demonstration #1\r\n* http://handsontable.com/ - demonstration #2 (stay tuned). \r\n* http://www.gfycat.com - better GIF\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\\* please, thing of that more in terms of joke or having fun than real opportunity to change my life.
