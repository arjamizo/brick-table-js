{"name":"Brick-table-js","tagline":"Awesome tool for claryfing whats in tables. ","body":"What's brick-table?\r\n===\r\n\r\nI am almost sure of one thing. We can see tables everywhere. In magazines, leaflets, bruchures, emails and even **in the Internet**. \r\nBut they always look the same. \r\n\r\nThis tool allows you changing that. You can make tablets less boring and more awesome. \r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n===\r\n\r\nIt simply moves (or changes its relative position) every odd row in table by half of its width to the right. *Yes, that's all*. **KISS, dude.**\r\n\r\nDemo\r\n===\r\n\r\n* Table containing a lot of data.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://zippy.gfycat.com/PessimisticPersonalAmericanblackvulture.gif\"/>\r\n\r\n* Excel-like table.\r\n\r\n_Coming soon._\r\n\r\nHow can I use it?\r\n===\r\n\r\nGo to your _Web Developer Console_ (probably `Crtl+Shift+J` or similar) and paste content of `brick-table.js` script. That's all. _No compilcated installation nor waiting hours for downloading._\r\n\r\nPossible usages\r\n===\r\n\r\n* simulating building houses without stopping looking at your screen (tables look like they were bricks), \r\n* trying what floor will look like before buying laminate flooring (aka pergo), \r\n* increasing cleariness and readability of presented data.\r\n\r\nTools used\r\n===\r\n\r\n* Maxthon browser - browser achieving the best ratio (plugins/sloweness)\r\n* jsbeautify.org - keeps code beautifuly indented\r\n* jquery - learning cells width\r\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions demonstration #1\r\n* http://handsontable.com/ - demonstration #2 (stay tuned). \r\n* http://www.gfycat.com - better GIF","google":"UA-54107856-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
